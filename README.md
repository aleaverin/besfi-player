mvPlayer-3D
===========

This is a mobile video player (in lack of a better name) made in Unity 3D.

The aim here is providing a channel as an app for whoever might be interested.

The app is **free** and **open source**. It should be financed through monetization methods within the contents.

Much more to come . . .
