besFi Player
===========

This is basically a video player made in Unity 3D.

"besFi" stands for "before electronic science Fiction" and while it's intially just a video player for mobile implementing it helps building the next one an esFi player. And eventually a few concepts from the next player will pop up here too.

The first goal here is providing a channel as an app for whoever might be interested.

The app is **free** and **open source**. It should be financed through monetization methods within the contents.

Much more to come . . .
